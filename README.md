## Project Details

### 1. Data Loading and Transformation
- Imported Houston budget data from four yearly files using the folder data source in Power BI.
- In Power Query:
  - Created a star schema with a `Budget` fact table and dimension tables for `Year`, `Function`, `Account Department`, and `Type`.
  - Added index keys, removed duplicates, and merged dimensions to form the fact table with necessary columns.
